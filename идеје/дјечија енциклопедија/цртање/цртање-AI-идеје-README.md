This algorithm learns to automatically color animation, adding natural color to black and white frames of anime. Researchers tested the system on recoloring anime like Dragon Ball and Little Witch Academia, and it does a shockingly good job. This could speed up animation in the future, by automating the coloring process once animators give the algorithms a few reference images.
